description: |-
    The CYP P450 genes are involved in the formation and breakdown (metabolism)
    of various molecules and chemicals within cells. Specifically, CYP2D6 is primarily
    expressed in the liver. It is also highly expressed in areas of the central
    nervous system, including the substantia nigra.

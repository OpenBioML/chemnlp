description: Repetitive exposure to a chemical agent can induce an immune reaction
  in inherently susceptible individuals that leads to skin sensitization. The dataset
  used in this study was retrieved from the ICCVAM (Interagency Coordinating Committee
  on the Validation of Alternative Methods) report on the rLLNA.

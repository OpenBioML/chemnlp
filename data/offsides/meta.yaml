    OffSIDES is a database of individual drug side effect
    signals mined from the FDA's Adverse Event Reporting System. The
    innovation of OffSIDES is that a propensity score matching (PSM) model
    is used to identify control drugs and produce better PRR estimates. In
    OffSIDES we focus on drug safety signals that are not already
    established by being listed on the structured product label - hence
    they are off-label drug side effects.

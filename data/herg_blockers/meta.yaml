description: "Human ether-à-go-go related gene (hERG) is crucial for the coordination\nof the heart's beating. Thus, if a drug blocks the hERG, it could
    lead to severe\nadverse effects. Therefore, reliable prediction of hERG liability in the early\nstages of drug design is quite important to reduce the
    risk of cardiotoxicity\nrelated attritions in the later development stages."

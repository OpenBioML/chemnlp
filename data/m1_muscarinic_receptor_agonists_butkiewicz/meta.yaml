description: "\n        Positive  allosteric modulation of the M1 Muscarinic receptor\
  \        screened with AID626.         Confirmed by screen AID 1488.        A second\
  \ counter screen AID 1741.        The final set of selective positive allosteric\
  \ modulators of M1        was obtained by removing compounds active in AID 1741\
  \         from the compounds active in AID 1488 resulting in 188 compounds.\n  \

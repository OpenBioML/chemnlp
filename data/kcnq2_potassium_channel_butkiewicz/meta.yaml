description: |-
    This dataset was initially curated from HTS data at
    the PubChem database. Details are reported by Butkiewicz et al. (2013).
    Primary screen AID 2239, AID 2287 validated active compounds to be
    potentiators. Counter screens are AID 2282, AID 2283, and AID 2558.
    Final set of 213 active compounds was acquired by removing the active
    compounds of AID 2282, AID 2283 and AID 2558 from the confirmatory
    screen active set of compounds (AID 2287).

    The Kir2.1 inward-rectifier potassium ion channel is
            a target in the treatment of cardiovascular, neurological, renal and
            metabolic disorders. Primary assay AID 1672. Validation screens AID
            2032 and AID 463252. Counter screens  AID 2105, AID 2345, AID 2236, and
            AID 2329. The final set of 172 active compounds was constructed
            subtracting the actives in AID 2105, AID 2345, AID 2236, and AID 2329
            from the molecules found active in both, AID 2032 and AID 463252

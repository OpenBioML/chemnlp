description: |-
    The human plasma protein binding rate (PPBR) is expressed as the percentage
    of a drug bound to plasma proteins in the blood. This rate strongly affect a drug's
    efficiency of delivery. The less bound a drug is, the more efficiently it can
    traverse and diffuse to the site of actions.

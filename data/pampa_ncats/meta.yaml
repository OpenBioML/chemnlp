description: PAMPA (parallel artificial membrane permeability assay) is a commonly         employed
  assay to evaluate drug permeability across the cellular membrane.         PAMPA
  is a non-cell-based, low-cost and high-throughput alternative to cellular models.         Although
  PAMPA does not model active and efflux transporters, it still provides permeability
  values         that are useful for absorption prediction because the majority of
  drugs are absorbed         by passive diffusion through the membrane.

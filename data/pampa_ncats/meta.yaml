description: "PAMPA (parallel artificial membrane permeability assay) is a commonly\n        employed assay to evaluate drug permeability across the cellular\
    \ membrane. PAMPA is a\n        non-cell-based, low-cost and high-throughput alternative to cellular models. Although\n        PAMPA does not model\
    \ active and efflux transporters, it still provides permeability values\n        that are useful for absorption prediction because the majority of drugs\
    \ are absorbed by\n        passive diffusion through the membrane."

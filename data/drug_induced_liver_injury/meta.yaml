    Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) is fatal liver disease caused by drugs
    and it has been the single most frequent cause of safety-related drug marketing
    withdrawals for the past 50 years (e.g. iproniazid, ticrynafen, benoxaprofen).
    This dataset is aggregated from U.S. FDA 2019s National Center for Toxicological
    Research.

name: TAP
description: "Immunogenicity, instability, self-association, \n        high viscosity, polyspecificity, or poor expression can all preclude\n        an\
    \ antibody from becoming a therapeutic. Early identification of these\n        negative characteristics is essential. Akin to the Lipinski guidelines,\n\
    \        which measure druglikeness in small molecules, \n        Therapeutic Antibody Profiler (TAP) highlights antibodies \n        that possess characteristics\
    \ that are rare/unseen in \n        clinical-stage mAb therapeutics."

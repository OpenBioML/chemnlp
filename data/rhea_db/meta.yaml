    Rhea is a freely available, manually annotated database of chemical reactions,
    created by the Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics (SIB) and used as source
    of chemical reactions for the UniProt Knowledgebase (UniProtKB) annotation.
    This dataset contains the reactions from Rhea database and their components
    in smiles format and ChEBI IDs.
    Tasks can be formulated as translation between smiles and english and vice
    versa, or as a completion of stechiometric coefficients or masked reactants.

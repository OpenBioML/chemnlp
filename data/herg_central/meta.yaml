    Human ether-a-go-go related gene (hERG) is crucial for the coordination
    of the heart's beating. Thus, if a drug blocks the hERG, it could lead to severe
    adverse effects. Therefore, reliable prediction of hERG liability in the early
    stages of drug design is quite important to reduce the risk of cardiotoxicity-related
    attritions in the later development stages. There are three targets: hERG_at_1microM,
    hERG_at_10microM, and hERG_inhib.

      description: whether it blocks (1) or not blocks (0). This is equivalent to whether hERG_at_10microM < -50, i.e. whether the compound has an IC50
          of less than 10microM.

name: flashpoint
description: |
    Curation of experimentally determined flash point values measured with open cup and closed cup methods.
    The values are from academic papers, the Hazardous Chemicals Handbook, and the PubChem chemical database.
    Differences from the stated sources in the paper are:
    * Values from the DIPPR database are not included in their dataset as they are proprietary.
    * There are appear to be no values from Lange's handbook of chemistry in their dataset.
    * We did our own processing to resolve duplicate SMILES.

description: |-
    Hemolysis is referred to the disruption of erythrocyte membranes that decrease the life span of red blood cells and causes the release of Hemoglobin.
    It is critical to identify non-hemolytic antimicrobial peptides as a non-toxic and safe measure against bacterial infections.
    However, distinguishing between hemolytic and non-hemolytic peptides is a challenge, since they primarily exert their activity at the charged surface of the bacterial plasma membrane.
    In this work, the hemolysis classifier is trained using data from the Database of Antimicrobial Activity and Structure of Peptides (DBAASP v3).
    Hemolytic activity is defined by extrapolating a measurement assuming dose response curves to the point at which 50\% of red blood cells are lysed.
    Activities below 100 mu g/ml, are considered hemolytic.
    The data contains sequences of only L- and canonical amino acids.
    Each measurement is treated independently, so sequences can appear multiple times.
    This experimental dataset contains noise, and in some observations (40%), an identical sequence appears in both negative and positive class.
    As an example, sequence "RVKRVWPLVIRTVIAGYNLYRAIKKK" is found to be both hemolytic and non-hemolytic in two different lab experiments (i.e. two different training examples).

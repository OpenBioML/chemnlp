description: "Hemolysis is referred to the disruption of erythrocyte\nmembranes that decrease the life span of red blood cells and causes\nthe release of\
    \ Hemoglobin. It is critical to identify non-hemolytic\nantimicrobial peptides as a non-toxic and safe measure against bacterial\ninfections. However,\
    \ distinguishing between hemolytic and non-hemolytic\npeptides is a challenge, since they primarily exert their activity at the\ncharged surface of\
    \ the bacterial plasma membrane.\nThe data here comes from the Database of Antimicrobial Activity and Structure of\nPeptides (DBAASP v3). Hemolytic\
    \ activity is defined by extrapolating a measurement\nassuming dose response curves to the point\nat which 50% of red blood cells are lysed. Activities\
    \ below 100 mu g/ml, are\nconsidered hemolytic.\nThe data contains sequences of only L- and canonical amino acids. Each measurement\nis treated independently,\
    \ so sequences can appear multiple times. This experimental\ndataset contains noise, and in some observations (40%), an identical sequence appears\n\
    in both negative and positive class. As an example, sequence \"RVKRVWPLVIRTVIAGYNLYRAIKKK\"\nis found to be both hemolytic and\nnon-hemolytic in two\
    \ different lab experiments (i.e. two different training examples). "

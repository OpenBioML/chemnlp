description: "Hemolysis is referred to the disruption of erythrocyte\n        membranes that decrease the life span of red blood cells and causes\n    \
    \    the release of Hemoglobin. It is critical to identify non-hemolytic\n        antimicrobial peptides as a non-toxic and safe measure against bacterial\n\
    \        infections. However, distinguishing between hemolytic and non-hemolytic\n        peptides is a challenge, since they primarily exert their\
    \ activity at the\n        charged surface of the bacterial plasma membrane.\n        The data here comes from the Database of Antimicrobial Activity\
    \ and Structure of\n        Peptides (DBAASP v3). Hemolytic activity is defined by extrapolating a measurement\n        assuming dose response curves\
    \ to the point\n        at which 50% of red blood cells are lysed. Activities below 100 mu g/ml, are\n        considered hemolytic.\n        The data\
    \ contains sequences of only L- and canonical amino acids. Each measurement\n        is treated independently, so sequences can appear multiple times.\
    \ This experimental\n        dataset contains noise, and in some observations (40%), an identical sequence appears\n        in both negative and positive\
    \ class. As an example, sequence \"RVKRVWPLVIRTVIAGYNLYRAIKKK\"\n        is found to be both hemolytic and\n        non-hemolytic in two different lab\
    \ experiments (i.e. two different training examples). "

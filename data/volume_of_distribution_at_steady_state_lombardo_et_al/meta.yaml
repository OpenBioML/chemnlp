description: |-
    The volume of distribution at steady state (VDss) measures the degree
    of a drug's concentration in the body tissue compared to concentration in the blood.
    Higher VD indicates a higher distribution in the tissue and usually indicates
    the drug with high lipid solubility, low plasma protein binidng rate.

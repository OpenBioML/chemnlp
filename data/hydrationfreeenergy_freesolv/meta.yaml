name: hydrationfreeenergy_freesolv
description: |-
  The Free Solvation Database, FreeSolv(SAMPL), provides experimental
  and calculated hydration free energy of small molecules in water. The calculated
  values are derived from alchemical free energy calculations using molecular
  dynamics simulations. From MoleculeNet.

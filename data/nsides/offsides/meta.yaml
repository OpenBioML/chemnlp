description: OffSIDES is a database of individual drug side effect signals mined from the FDA's Adverse Event Reporting System. The innovation of OffSIDES
    is that a propensity score matching (PSM) model is used to identify control drugs and produce better PRR estimates. In OffSIDES we focus on drug safety
    signals that are not already established by being listed on the structured product label -- hence they are off-label drug side effects.

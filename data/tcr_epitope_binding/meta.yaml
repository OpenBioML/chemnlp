  T-cells are an integral part of the adaptive immune system, whose survival, proliferation, activation
      and function are all governed by the interaction of their T-cell receptor (TCR) with immunogenic peptides (epitopes).
      A large repertoire of T-cell receptors with different specificity is needed to provide protection against a wide range of pathogens.
      This new task aims to predict the binding affinity given a pair of TCR sequence and epitope sequence.

description: |-
    T-cells are an integral part of the adaptive immune system, whose survival, proliferation,
            activationand function are all governed by the interaction of their T-cell receptor (TCR) with immunogenic
            peptides (epitopes).A large repertoire of T-cell receptors with different specificity is needed to provide
            protection against a wide range of pathogens.This new task aims to predict the binding affinity
            given a pair of TCR sequence and epitope sequence.

description: |-
  As a membrane separating circulating blood and brain extracellular
  fluid, the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is the protection layer that blocks most
  foreign drugs. Thus the ability of a drug to penetrate the barrier to deliver
  to the site of action forms a crucial challenge in development of drugs for
  central nervous system From MoleculeNet.

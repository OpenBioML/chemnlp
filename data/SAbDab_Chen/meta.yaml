description: "Antibody data from Chen et al, where they process from the SAbDab. \n        From an initial dataset of 3816 antibodies, they retained 2426\
    \ antibodies\n        that satisfy the following criteria: 1. \n        have both sequence (FASTA) and Protein Data Bank (PDB) structure files,\n  \
    \      2. contain both a heavy chain and a light chain, and 3. \n        have crystal structures with resolution < 3 Ã…. \n        The DI label is derived\
    \ from BIOVIA's pipelines."

name: Plasma_Protein_Binding_Rate_AstraZeneca
description: The human plasma protein binding rate (PPBR) is expressed as the percentage
  of a drug bound to plasma proteins in the blood. This rate strongly affect a drug's
  efficiency of delivery. The less bound a drug is, the more efficiently it can traverse
  and diffuse to the site of actions. From a ChEMBL assay deposited by AstraZeneca.

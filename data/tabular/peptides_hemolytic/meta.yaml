description: "Hemolysis is referred to the disruption of erythrocyte\nmembranes that\
  \ decrease the life span of red blood cells and causes\nthe release of Hemoglobin.\
  \ It is critical to identify non-hemolytic\nantimicrobial peptides as a non-toxic\
  \ and safe measure against bacterial\ninfections. However, distinguishing between\
  \ hemolytic and non-hemolytic\npeptides is a challenge, since they primarily exert\
  \ their activity at the\ncharged surface of the bacterial plasma membrane.\nThe\
  \ data here comes from the Database of Antimicrobial Activity and Structure of\n\
  Peptides (DBAASP v3). Hemolytic activity is defined by extrapolating a measurement\n\
  assuming dose response curves to the point\nat which 50% of red blood cells are\
  \ lysed. Activities below 100 mu g/ml, are\nconsidered hemolytic.\nThe data contains\
  \ sequences of only L- and canonical amino acids. Each measurement\nis treated independently,\
  \ so sequences can appear multiple times. This experimental\ndataset contains noise,\
  \ and in some observations (40%), an identical sequence appears\nin both negative\
  \ and positive class. As an example, sequence \"RVKRVWPLVIRTVIAGYNLYRAIKKK\"\nis\
  \ found to be both hemolytic and\nnon-hemolytic in two different lab experiments\
  \ (i.e. two different training examples). "

membranes that decrease the life span of red blood cells and causes
the release of Hemoglobin. It is critical to identify non-hemolytic
antimicrobial peptides as a non-toxic and safe measure against bacterial
infections. However, distinguishing between hemolytic and non-hemolytic
peptides is a challenge, since they primarily exert their activity at the
charged surface of the bacterial plasma membrane.
The data here comes from the Database of Antimicrobial Activity and Structure of
Peptides (DBAASP v3). Hemolytic activity is defined by extrapolating a measurement
assuming dose response curves to the point
at which 50% of red blood cells are lysed. Activities below 100 mu g/ml, are
considered hemolytic.
The data contains sequences of only L- and canonical amino acids. Each measurement
is treated independently, so sequences can appear multiple times. This experimental
dataset contains noise, and in some observations (40%), an identical sequence appears
in both negative and positive class. As an example, sequence "RVKRVWPLVIRTVIAGYNLYRAIKKK"
is found to be both hemolytic and
non-hemolytic in two different lab experiments (i.e. two different training examples). """,

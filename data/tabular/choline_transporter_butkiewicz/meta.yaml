description: |-
    This dataset was originally curated from HTS data at
    the PubChem database. The primary screen AID 488975 identified
    inhibitors of CHT. The counter screen AID 493221 was used as a
    validation screen to confirm the active compounds that inhibit CHT.
    AID504840 and AID588401 experiments were used as additional validation
    experiments. The screen AID 493222 evaluated remaining active compounds
    for non-specific activity in parental HEK293 cells. AID602208 tested a
    selected set of compounds for 3H choline uptake. The final set of 254
    active compounds was determined by the overlap of active compounds in
    screens AID 493221, AID504840, and AID588401 subtracting any
    non-specific hits from AID 49322 and all inactive compounds in the
    re-confirmation screen AID602208.

description: |-
    P-glycoprotein (Pgp) is an ABC transporter protein involved in intestinal
    absorption, drug metabolism, and brain penetration, and its inhibition can seriously
    alter a drug's bioavailability and safety. In addition, inhibitors of Pgp can
    be used to overcome multidrug resistance.

name: qm9
description: |-
    QM9 is a comprehensive dataset that provides geometric, energetic,
    electronic and thermodynamic properties for a subset of GDB-17
    database, comprising 134 thousand stable organic molecules with up
    to 9 heavy atoms.  All molecules are modeled using density
    functional theory (B3LYP/6-31G(2df,p) based DFT).

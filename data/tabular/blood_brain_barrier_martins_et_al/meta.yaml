description: |-
    As a membrane separating circulating blood and brain extracellular
    fluid, the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is the protection layer that blocks most
    foreign drugs. Thus the ability of a drug to penetrate the barrier to deliver
    to the site of action forms a crucial challenge in development of drugs for the
    central nervous system.

    - The {#polymer|di-block copolymer|copolymer!} with BigSMILES {BigSMILES#}, {Mn__names__noun} of {Mn#} {Mn__units}, {f1__names__noun} of {f1#}{Mw#}{D#}
      was {#measured|analyzed|studied!} at {T#} {T__units} and found to be in the {phase1#} phase.

      Question: If I have a {#polymer|di-block copolymer|copolymer!} with {Mn__names__noun} of {Mn#} {Mn__units}, {f1__names__noun} of {f1#}{Mw#}{D#}, what phase will it be in at {T#} {T__units}?
      Answer: The polymer will be in the {phase1#} phase.

      User: I want to design a {#polymer|di-block copolymer|copolymer!} with a particular {Mn__names__noun}, {f1__names__noun}, and {phase1__names__noun}.
      Assistant: {#Cool, |Awesome, |Great, |That sounds interesting, !}I would need to know the {Mn__names__noun}, {f1__names__noun}, and {phase1__names__noun} of the polymer you want to design.
      User: The {Mn__names__noun} should be {Mn#} {Mn__units}, the {f1__names__noun} should be {f1#}, and the {phase1__names__noun} should be {phase1#}.
      Assistant: I {#recommend|suggest|propose|advise!} the {#polymer|di-block copolymer|copolymer!} with BigSMILES {BigSMILES#}{Mw#}{D#}.

      User: I want to design a {#polymer|di-block copolymer|copolymer!} that is in the {phase1#} phase.
      Assistant: {#Cool, |Awesome, |Great, |That sounds interesting, !}{#do you have any other constraints?|do you have other requirements?|what else should I take into account?!}
      User: The {Mn__names__noun} should be {Mn#} {Mn__units}, the {f1__names__noun} should be {f1#}.

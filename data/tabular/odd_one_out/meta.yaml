    Task: You are given a {#list|sequence!} of SMILES of {#molecules|chemicals|chemical compounds!} and {#must|are asked to!} find the {#molecule|chemical|compound!} that is {#most|maximally!} different from the others.
    Molecules: {smi_1#}, {smi_2#}, {smi_3#}, and {smi_4#}
    Constraint: Answer by returning the SMILES string. Similarity is measured in terms of Tanimoto distance between Morgan fingerprints of radius {#two|2!}.
    Answer: {odd_one_out_mol#}

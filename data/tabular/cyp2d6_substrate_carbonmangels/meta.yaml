description: |-
    CYP2D6 is primarily expressed in the liver. It is also highly expressed
    in areas of the central nervous system, including the substantia nigra. TDC
    used a dataset from Carbon Mangels et al, which merged information on substrates
    and nonsubstrates from six publications.

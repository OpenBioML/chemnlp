description: |-
    The serine/threonine kinase, STK33, has been shown to
    be relevant for proliferation of mutant KRAS-dependent cells involved
    in cancer. Primary screen AID 2661. Counter screen AID 2821. AID504583
    as validation screen. Actives in AID 2821 subtracted by the actives
    from screen AID504583 resulted in the final set of 172 active
    compounds.

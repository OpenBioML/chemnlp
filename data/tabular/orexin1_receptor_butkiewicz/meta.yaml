    "GPCR Orexin 1 is relevant for behavioral plasticity,
    the sleep-wake cycle, and gastric acid secretion.Three primary screens,
    AID 485270, AID 463079, AID 434989, were performed. Validation assay
    AID504701, AD492963. Counter screen 493232. More specific assay
    AID504699. AID504701 and AID504699 were combined to identify 234 active
    compounds excluding an overlap of 155 molecules.

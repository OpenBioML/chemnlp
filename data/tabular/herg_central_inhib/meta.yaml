description: "Human ether-à-go-go related gene (hERG) is crucial for the coordination\nof the heart's beating. Thus, if a drug blocks the hERG, it could\
    \ lead to severe\nadverse effects. Therefore, reliable prediction of hERG liability in the early\nstages of drug design is quite important to reduce\
    \ the risk of cardiotoxicity-related\nattritions in the later development stages. There are three targets: hERG_at_1microM,\nhERG_at_10microM, and herg_inhib."

          whether it blocks (1) or not blocks (0) hERG
          (This is equivalent to whether hERG_at_10microM < -50, i.e.,
          whether the compound has an IC50 of less than 10microM.)

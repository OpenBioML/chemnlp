description: |-
  Solubility was estimated by retrospective analysis of electronic laboratory notebooks.
          The notebooks were part of a large effort called the Protein Structure Initiative and consider sequences
          linearly through the following stages: Selected,  Cloned,  Expressed,  Soluble,  Purified, Crystallized,
          HSQC (heteronuclear single quantum coherence), Structure, and deposited in PDB. The peptides were identified
          as soluble or insoluble by "Comparing the experimental status at two time points, September 2009 and May 2010,
          we were able to derive a set of insoluble proteins defined as those which were not
          soluble in September 2009 and still remained in that state 8 months later."

description: |-
    The CYP P450 genes are involved in the formation and breakdown (metabolism)
    of various molecules and chemicals within cells. Specifically, CYP3A4 is an
    important enzyme in the body, mainly found in the liver and in the intestine.
    It oxidizes small foreign organic molecules (xenobiotics), such as toxins or
    drugs, so that they can be removed from the body.

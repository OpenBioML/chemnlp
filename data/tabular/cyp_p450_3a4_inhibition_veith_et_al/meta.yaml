description: |-
  The CYP P450 genes are involved in the formation and breakdown (metabolism)
  of various molecules and chemicals within cells. Specifically, CYP3A4 is an
  important enzyme in the body, mainly found in the liver and in the intestine.
  It oxidizes small foreign organic molecules (xenobiotics), such as toxins or
  drugs, so that they can be removed from the body.

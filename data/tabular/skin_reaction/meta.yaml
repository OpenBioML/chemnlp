description: |-
  Repetitive exposure to a chemical agent can induce an immune reaction
  in inherently susceptible individuals that leads to skin sensitization. The
  dataset used in this study was retrieved from the ICCVAM (Interagency Coordinating
  Committee on the Validation of Alternative Methods) report on the rLLNA.

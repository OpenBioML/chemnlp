description: |-
    Repetitive exposure to a chemical agent can induce an immune reaction
    in inherently susceptible individuals that leads to skin sensitization. The
    dataset used in this study was retrieved from the ICCVAM (Interagency Coordinating
    Committee on the Validation of Alternative Methods) report on the rLLNA.

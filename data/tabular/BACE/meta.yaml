name: BACE
description: |-
    The BACE dataset provides quantitative pIC50 and qualitative (binary label) binding results for
    a set of inhibitors of human beta-secretase 1 (BACE-1). All data are experimental values reported
    in scientific literature over the past decade, some with detailed crystal structures available.

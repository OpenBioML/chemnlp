  ChEMBL is a manually curated database of bioactive molecules with drug-like properties.
  It brings together chemical, bioactivity and genomic data
  to aid the translation of genomic information into effective new drugs.

  (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl), previously described in the 2012,
  2014 and 2017 Nucleic Acids Research Database Issues.
  In the last two years, several important improvements have been made to the database and are described here.
  These include more robust capture and representation of assay details;
  a new data deposition system, allowing updating of data sets and deposition of supplementary data;
  and a completely redesigned web interface, with enhanced search and filtering capabilities.}",

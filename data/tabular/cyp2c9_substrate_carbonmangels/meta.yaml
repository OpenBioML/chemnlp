description: |-
  CYP P450 2C9 plays a major role in the oxidation of both xenobiotic
  and endogenous compounds. Substrates are drugs that are metabolized by the enzyme.
  TDC used a dataset from Carbon Mangels et al, which merged information on substrates
  and nonsubstrates from six publications.

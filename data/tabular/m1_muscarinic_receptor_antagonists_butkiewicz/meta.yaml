description: |-
    Primary screen AID628 confirmed by screen AID677.
    AID859 confirmed activity on rat M1 receptor.
    The counter screen AID860 removed non-selective compounds
    being active also at the rat M4 receptor.
    Final set of active compoundsobtained by subtracting active compounds of AID860
    from those in AID677, resulting in 448 total active compounds.
targets:
    - id: m1_muscarinic_antagonist
      description: whether it negatively modulates the m1 muscarinic receptor (1) or not (0).

description: |-
  Primary screen AID628 confirmed by screen AID677.
  AID859 confirmed activity on rat M1 receptor.
  The counter screen AID860 removed non-selective compounds
  being active also at the rat M4 receptor.
  Final set of active compoundsobtained by subtracting active compounds of AID860
  from those in AID677, resulting in 448 total active compounds.

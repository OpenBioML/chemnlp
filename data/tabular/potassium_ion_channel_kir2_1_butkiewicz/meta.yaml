description: |-
  The Kir2.1 inward-rectifier potassium ion channel is
  a target in the treatment of cardiovascular, neurological, renal and
  metabolic disorders. Primary assay AID 1672. Validation screens AID
  2032 and AID 463252. Counter screens  AID 2105, AID 2345, AID 2236, and
  AID 2329. The final set of 172 active compounds was constructed
  subtracting the actives in AID 2105, AID 2345, AID 2236, and AID 2329
  from the molecules found active in both, AID 2032 and AID 463252
targets:
  - id: activity_potassium_ion_channel
    description: whether it is active against potassium ion channel (1) or not (0).
    units:
    type: boolean
    names:
      - gerund: blocking the potassium ion channel
      - noun: blocker of the potassium ion channel activity
      - adjective: effective for the blocking potassium ion channel activity
      - adjective: reliable for potassium ion channel blocking

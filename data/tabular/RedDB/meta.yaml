    RedDB: a computational database that contains 30861 molecules
    from two prominent classes of organic electroactive compounds, quinones and aza-aromatics,
    has been presented. RedDB incorporates miscellaneous physicochemical property information
    of the compounds that can potentially be employed as battery performance descriptors.
    RedDBs development steps, including:
    (i) chemical library generation,
    (ii) molecular property prediction based on quantum chemical calculations,
    (iii) aqueous solubility prediction using machine learning,
    (iv) data processing and database creation, have been described.

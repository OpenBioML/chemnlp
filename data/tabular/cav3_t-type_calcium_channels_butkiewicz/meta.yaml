description: |-
    This dataset was initially curated from HTS data at the PubChem database.
    The curation process is documented in Butkiewicz et al.
    Primary screening with AID 449739 identified inhibitors of Cav3 T-type calcium channels.
    Four follow-up screens were performed to confirm inhibitory effects on smaller sets of compounds
    involving AID 493021, AID 493022, AID 493023, and AID 493041.
    AID 489005 was performed as counter screen validating active compounds of the primary screen.

description: |-
    The blood-brain barrier penetration (BBBP) dataset is designed for the
    modeling and prediction of barrier permeability. As a membrane separating
    circulating blood and brain extracellular fluid, the blood-brain barrier
    blocks most drugs, hormones, and neurotransmitters. Thus penetration of the
    barrier forms a long-standing issue in the development of drugs targeting
    the central nervous system. This dataset includes binary labels for over 2000 
    compounds on their permeability properties.

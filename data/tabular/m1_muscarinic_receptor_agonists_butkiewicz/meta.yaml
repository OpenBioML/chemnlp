description: |-
    Positive  allosteric modulation of the M1 Muscarinic
    receptor screened with AID626.  Confirmed by screen AID 1488.  A second
    counter screen AID 1741.  The final set of selective positive
    allosteric modulators of M1 was obtained by removing compounds active
    in AID 1741 from the compounds active in AID 1488 resulting in 188
    compounds.

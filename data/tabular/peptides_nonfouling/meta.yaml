    Non-fouling is defined as resistance to non-specific interactions.
    A non-fouling peptide (positive example) is defined using the mechanism proposed in
    ref white2012decoding. Briefly, ref white2012decoding, showed that the exterior surfaces
    of proteins have a significantly different frequency of amino acids, and this increases
    in aggregation prone environments, like the cytoplasm. Synthesizing self-assembling peptides
    that follow this amino acid distribution and coating surfaces with the peptides creates
    non-fouling surfaces. This pattern was also found inside chaperone proteins,
    another area where resistance to non-specific interactions is important (ref white2012role).

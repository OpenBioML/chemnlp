        The automatic extraction of chemical information from text requires the
        recognition of chemical entity mentions as one of its key steps. When
        developing supervised named entity recognition (NER) systems, the
        availability of a large, manually annotated text corpus is desirable.
        Furthermore, large corpora permit the robust evaluation and comparison of
        different approaches that detect chemicals in documents. We present the
        CHEMDNER corpus, a collection of 10,000 PubMed abstracts that contain a
        total of 84,355 chemical entity mentions labeled manually by expert
        chemistry literature curators, following annotation guidelines specifically
        defined for this task. The abstracts of the CHEMDNER corpus were selected
        to be representative for all major chemical disciplines. Each of the
        chemical entity mentions was manually labeled according to its
        structure-associated chemical entity mention (SACEM) class: abbreviation,
        family, formula, identifier, multiple, systematic and trivial. The
        difficulty and consistency of tagging chemicals in text was measured using
        an agreement study between annotators, obtaining a percentage agreement of
        91. For a subset of the CHEMDNER corpus (the test set of 3,000 abstracts)
        we provide not only the Gold Standard manual annotations, but also mentions
        automatically detected by the 26 teams that participated in the BioCreative
        IV CHEMDNER chemical mention recognition task. In addition, we release the
        CHEMDNER silver standard corpus of automatically extracted mentions from
        17,000 randomly selected PubMed abstracts. A version of the CHEMDNER corpus
        in the BioC format has been generated as well. We propose a standard for
        required minimum information about entity annotations for the construction
        of domain specific corpora on chemical and drug entities. The CHEMDNER
        corpus and annotation guidelines are available at:

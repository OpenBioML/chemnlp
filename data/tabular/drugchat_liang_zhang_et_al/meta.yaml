    Instruction tuning dataset used for the LLM component of DrugChat.
    10,834 compounds (3,8962  from ChEMBL and 6,942 from  PubChem) containing
    descriptive drug information were collected. 143,517 questions were generated
    using the molecules' classification, properties and descriptions from ChEBI, LOTUS & YMDB.

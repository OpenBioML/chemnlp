    PAMPA (parallel artificial membrane permeability assay) is a commonly
    employed assay to evaluate drug permeability across the cellular membrane.
    PAMPA is a non-cell-based, low-cost and high-throughput alternative to cellular models.
    Although PAMPA does not model active and efflux transporters, it still provides permeability values
    that are useful for absorption prediction because the majority of drugs are absorbed
    by passive diffusion through the membrane.

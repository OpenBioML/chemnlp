name: IUPAC Compendium of Chemical Terminology
description: |-
    The Compendium is popularly referred to as the Gold
    Book, in recognition of the contribution of the late Victor Gold, who
    initiated work on the first edition. It is one of the series of IUPAC
    Colour Books on chemical nomenclature, terminology, symbols and units
    (see the list of source documents), and collects together terminology
    definitions from IUPAC recommendations already published in Pure and
    Applied Chemistry and in the other Colour Books. Terminology
    definitions published by IUPAC are drafted by international committees
    of experts in the appropriate chemistry sub-disciplines, and ratified
    by IUPAC's Interdivisional Committee on Terminology, Nomenclature and
    Symbols (ICTNS). In this edition of the Compendium these IUPAC-approved
    definitions are supplemented with some definitions from ISO and from
    the International Vocabulary of Basic and General Terms in Metrology,
    both these sources are recognised by IUPAC as authoritative. The result
    is a collection of nearly 7000 terms, with authoritative definitions,
    spanning the whole range of chemistry.

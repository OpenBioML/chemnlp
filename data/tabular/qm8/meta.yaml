name: qm8
description: |-
    QM8 is a dataset of quantum mechanical simulations of electronic spectra 
    and the energy levels of excited states in small molecules. 
    The dataset involves the application of various techniques, 
    such as time-dependent density functional theories (TDDFT) 
    and second-order approximate coupled-cluster (CC2), 
    to a group of molecules, which encompasses those containing as many as eight heavy atoms. 
    These molecules also form a subset of the GDB-17 database.

description: 'These are nine high-quality high-throughput screening (HTS) datasets from [1]. These datasets were curated from HTS data at the PubChem database
    [2]. Typically, HTS categorizes small molecules into hit, inactive, or unspecified against a certain therapeutic target. However, a compound may be
    falsely classified as a hit due to experimental artifacts such as optical interference. Moreover, because the screening is performed without duplicates,
    and the cutoff is often set loose to minimize the false negative rates, the results from the primary screens often contain high false positive rates
    [3]. Hence the result from the primary screen is only used as the first iteration to reduce the compound library to a smaller set of further confirmatory
    tests. Here each dataset is carefully collated through confirmation screens to validate active compounds. The curation process is documented in [1].
    Each dataset is identified by the PubChem Assay ID (AID). Features of the datasets: (1) At least 150 confirmed active compounds present; (2) Diverse
    target classes; (3) Realistic (large number and highly imbalanced label).'

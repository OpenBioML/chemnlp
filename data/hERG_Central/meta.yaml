description: "Human ether-\xE0-go-go related gene (hERG) is crucial for the coordination\
  \ of the heart's beating. Thus, if a drug blocks the hERG, it could lead to severe\
  \ adverse effects. Therefore, reliable prediction of hERG liability in the early\
  \ stages of drug design is quite important to reduce the risk of cardiotoxicity-related\
  \ attritions in the later development stages. There are three targets: hERG_at_1uM,\
  \ hERG_at_10uM, and hERG_inhib."

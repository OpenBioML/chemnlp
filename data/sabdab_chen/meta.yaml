    Antibody data from Chen et al, where they process from the SAbDab.
    From an initial dataset of 3816 antibodies, they retained 2426 antibodies that
    satisfy the following criteria: 1.have both sequence (FASTA) and Protein Data
    Bank (PDB) structure files, 2. contain both a heavy chain and a light chain,
    and 3. have crystal structures with resolution < 0.3 nm. The DI label is derived
    from BIOVIA's pipelines.

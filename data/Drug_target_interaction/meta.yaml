description: |-
    The activity of a small-molecule drug is measured by its binding affinity with the target protein.
            Given a new target protein, the very first step is to screen a set of potential compounds to find their activity.
            Traditional method to gauge the affinities are through high-throughput screening wet-lab experiments.
            However, they are very expensive and are thus restricted by their abilities to search over a large set of candidates
            Drug-target interaction prediction task aims to predict the interaction activity score in silico given only the accessible compound structural information and protein amino acid sequence.

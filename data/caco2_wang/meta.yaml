description: "The human colon epithelial cancer cell line, Caco-2, is used as an in vitro model\n        to simulate the human intestinal tissue. The experimental\
    \ result on the rate of drug passing through\n        the Caco-2 cells can approximate the rate at which the drug permeates through the human intestinal\
    \ tissue."

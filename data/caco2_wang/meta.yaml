    The human colon epithelial cancer cell line, Caco-2,
    is used as an in vitro model to simulate the human intestinal tissue.
    The experimental result on the rate of drug passing through
    the Caco-2 cells can approximate the rate at which the drug permeates
    through the human intestinal tissue.

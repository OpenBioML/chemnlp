description: The human colon epithelial cancer cell line, Caco-2,         is used as an in vitro model to simulate the human intestinal tissue.         The
    experimental result on the rate of drug passing through         the Caco-2 cells can approximate the rate at which the drug permeates         through
    the human intestinal tissue.

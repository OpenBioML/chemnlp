    The CYP P450 genes are essential in the breakdown (metabolism) of
    various molecules and chemicals within cells. A drug that can inhibit these
    enzymes would mean poor metabolism to this drug and other drugs, which could lead
    to drug-drug interactions and adverse effects. Specifically, the CYP2C19 gene
    provides instructions for making an enzyme of the endoplasmic reticulum, which
    is involved in protein processing and transport.

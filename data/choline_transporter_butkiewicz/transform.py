        This dataset was originally curated from HTS data at the PubChem database.   \
        The primary screen AID 488975 identified inhibitors of CHT. \
        The counter screen AID 493221 was used as a validation screen \
            to confirm the active compounds that inhibit CHT. \
        AID504840 and AID588401 experiments were used as additional validation experiments. \
        The screen AID 493222 evaluated remaining active compounds for non-specific activity \
              in parental HEK293 cells. \
        AID602208 tested a selected set of compounds for 3H choline uptake. \
        The final set of 254 active compounds was determined by the overlap of active compounds \
            in screens AID 493221, AID504840, and AID588401 \
            subtracting any non-specific hits from AID 49322 \
        and all inactive compounds in the re-confirmation screen AID602208.

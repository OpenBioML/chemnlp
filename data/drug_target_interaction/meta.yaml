name: drug-target interaction
description: |-
    The activity of a small-molecule drug is measured by
    its binding affinity with the target protein. Given a new target
    protein, the very first step is to screen a set of potential compounds
    to find their activity.Traditional method to gauge the affinities are
    through high-throughput screening wet-lab experiments. However, they
    are very expensive and are thus restricted by their abilities to search
    over a large set of candidates. Drug-target interaction prediction task
    aims to predict the interaction activity score in silico given only the
    accessible compound structural information and protein amino acid
    sequence.

name: Volume_of_Distribution_at_steady_state_Lombardo_et_al
description: The volume of distribution at steady state (VDss) measures the degree
  of a drug s concentration in body tissue compared to concentration in blood. Higher
  VD indicates a higher distribution in the tissue and usually indicates the drug
  with high lipid solubility, low plasma protein binidng rate.

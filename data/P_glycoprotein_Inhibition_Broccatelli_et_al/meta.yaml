name: P_glycoprotein_Inhibition_Broccatelli_et_al
description: P-glycoprotein (Pgp) is an ABC transporter protein involved in intestinal
  absorption, drug metabolism, and brain penetration, and its inhibition can seriously
  alter a drug's bioavailability and safety. In addition, inhibitors of Pgp can be
  used to overcome multidrug resistance.

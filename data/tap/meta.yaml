    Immunogenicity, instability, self-association,
    high viscosity, polyspecificity, or poor expression can all preclude
    an antibody from becoming a therapeutic. Early identification of these
    negative characteristics is essential. Akin to the Lipinski guidelines,
    which measure druglikeness in small molecules,
    Therapeutic Antibody Profiler (TAP) highlights antibodies
    that possess characteristics that are rare/unseen in
    clinical-stage mAb therapeutics.

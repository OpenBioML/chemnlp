description: |-
    CYP3A4 is an important enzyme in the body, mainly found in the liver
    and in the intestine. It oxidizes small foreign organic molecules (xenobiotics),
    such as toxins or drugs, so that they can be removed from the body. TDC used
    a dataset from Carbon Mangels et al, which merged information on substrates
    and nonsubstrates from six publications.

description: |-
    The CYP P450 genes are involved in the formation and breakdown (metabolism)
    of various molecules and chemicals within cells. Specifically, CYP1A2 localizes
    to the endoplasmic reticulum and its expression is induced by some polycyclic
    aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), some of which are found in cigarette smoke. It
    is able to metabolize some PAHs to carcinogenic intermediates. Other xenobiotic
    substrates for this enzyme include caffeine, aflatoxin B1, and acetaminophen.

description: |-
  Drug clearance is defined as the volume of plasma cleared of a drug
  over a specified time period and it measures the rate at which the active drug
  is removed from the body. This is a dataset curated from ChEMBL database containing
  experimental results on intrinsic clearance, deposited from AstraZeneca. It
  contains clearance measures from two experiments types, hepatocyte and microsomes.

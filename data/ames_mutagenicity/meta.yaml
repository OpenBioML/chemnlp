description: |-
    Mutagenicity means the ability of a drug to induce genetic alterations.
    Drugs that can cause damage to the DNA can result in cell death or other severe
    adverse effects. Nowadays, the most widely used assay for testing the mutagenicity
    of compounds is the Ames experiment which was invented by a professor named
    Ames. The Ames test is a short term bacterial reverse mutation assay detecting
    a large number of compounds which can induce genetic damage and frameshift mutations.
    The dataset is aggregated from four papers.

# ChemNLP project ðŸ§ªðŸš€
The ChemNLP project aims to
1) create an extensive chemistry dataset and
1) use it to train large language models (LLMs) that can leverage the data for a wide range of chemistry applications.

For more details see our [information material section below](#information-material).

# Note on the "ChemNLP" name
Our OpenBioML ChemNLP project is not afiliated to the [ChemNLP library from NIST](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.08203) and we use "ChemNLP" as a general term to highlight our project focus. The datasets and models we create through our project will have a unique and recognizable name when we release them.
